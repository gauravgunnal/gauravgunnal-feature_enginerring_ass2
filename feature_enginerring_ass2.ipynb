    "'''Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to scale and transform the features of a dataset within a specific range. The purpose is to bring all the features to a common scale without distorting the differences in the range of values. This can be particularly useful in machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features, such as gradient-based optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Min-Max scaling formula for a feature \\(x\\) in a dataset is given by:\n",

The choice of scaling method depends on the characteristics of the data and the requirements of the machine learning algorithm being used.'''\n",
